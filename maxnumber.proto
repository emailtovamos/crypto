// The client will send signature, the data(number), his public key and his private key
// The server will verify the signature and decode the data
// The server saves the current high data obviously
// proto file should have big.Int to create message for pivate key and public key


// Questions

// Does the client really need his private key? Or just his public key?
// Yes

// Client side ------------>
// For signature -> Required -> Private key and message
// For cipherText -> Required -> Public key and message

// <-----------Server side 
// To decrypt -> cipherText and private key
// to verify signature -> plain text, signature, public key

// Search for private key public key rsa gRPC protocol buffer 
// How to proto marshal private key????????????
